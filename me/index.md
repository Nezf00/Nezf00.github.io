Hi, I'm FerrÃ¡n â€” also known as Nezf.

I'm an independent offensive security learner with a strong focus on real-world hacking, system exploitation, and tool development.  
I didnâ€™t come from a traditional background. I learned by doing â€” failing fast, breaking things, and writing my own tools to understand how systems fall apart.

Most of my time goes into pentesting labs, building my own internal framework, and exploring offensive techniques across infrastructure, web, and post-exploitation.  
Platforms like Hack The Box, TryHackMe, and custom local labs are my daily training ground.

Beyond hacking, I'm also a content creator.  
I document my journey through writeups, tools, and YouTube videos â€” blending cybersecurity with hands-on DIY tech projects.  
Sometimes it's code. Sometimes it's circuits, shells, solder, or scripts.  
But itâ€™s always about building and breaking with intention.

I believe in staying sharp, staying humble, and always creating with purpose.

Some places where I train or hunt:
- [Hack The Box](https://app.hackthebox.com) â€“ Realistic infrastructure and red team labs  
- [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com) â€“ Guided rooms & challenges  
- [Root-Me](https://www.root-me.org) â€“ Classic and creative wargames  
- [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com) â€“ Bug bounties, real impact  
- [YouTube â€“ notnezf](https://www.youtube.com/@notnezf) â€“ My home for creative and offensive content
